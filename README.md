# Structuring data with pandas
During my time at the university I helped another group who study economics with their data while they were writting their master thesis. The students were doing some changes on an excel file manually, which would take them weeks to be done with, then my supervisor reached out to me (he was also their supervisor) and asked me if I could help them. I probably saved them some weeks of work, since my structuring program was done in the same day they asked me. Here is the small program I did to structure the data the way they wanted to.

## What I have learned on this project
I learned that I love to make some sence of unstructure data and make them useful :heart:!!
